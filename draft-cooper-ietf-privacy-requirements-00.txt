                Privacy Requirements for IETF Protocols
             draft-cooper-ietf-privacy-requirements-00.txt

Abstract

   It is the consensus of the IETF that IETF protocols be designed to
   avoid egregious privacy violations to the extent possible.  This
   document establishes a number of protocol design choices as Best
   Current Practices for the purpose of avoiding such violations.

Status of this Memo

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

Internet-Draft   Privacy Requirements for IETF Protocols  September 2013


1.  Introduction

   The IETF has long-standing principles that support strong security in
   protocol design and a tradition of encouraging protocol designers to
   take these principles into account.  [RFC1984] articulated the view
   that encryption is an important tool to protect the cofidentiality of
   communications, and that as such it should be encouraged and
   available to all.  [RFC3365] requires that all protocols implement
   strong security.  [RFC3552] provides guidance about how to consider
   security in protocol design and how to document security choices.  In
   [RFC2804], the IETF established a policy of not considering
   wiretapping requirements in IETF protocols.  [RFC6973] explains the
   many different aspects of privacy that can be affected by Internet
   protocol design and provides guidance to help designers consider
   privacy in their work.  This document extends the existing body of
   IETF principles concerning security by articulating Best Current
   Practices for avoiding egregious privacy violations and establishing
   support for privacy as a principle of IETF protocol design.

   Discussion of this draft is directed to the ietf-privacy@ietf.org
   list.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].  These words take their normative meanings only when they
   are presented in ALL UPPERCASE.

   "Opportunistic encryption" is defined as encryption without any pre-
   arrangement specific to the pair of systems involved (see [RFC4322]).

   Privacy-specific terminology is provided in [RFC6973].  Of particular
   relevance to this document is the term "personal data," defined as
   "any information relating to an individual who can be identified,
   directly or indirectly."

3.  Recommendations

   IETF protocols that allow personal data to be stored by hosts risk
   assisting in the build up of large databases of information that by
   themselves or in conjunction with other databases, can identify
   people and their actions in invasive ways.

   Therefore, to the extent consistent with basic protocol operation and
   management, standards-track IETF protocols that involve transmission
   of personal data:

   1.  MUST minimize their use of such information and where that
       information is sent,

   2.  MUST have well-defined and interoperable ways to send such data
       encrypted for the intended recipient(s).

   As a consequence, at minimum, opportunistic encryption needs to be
   well-defined for almost all new IETF standards track protocols.  In
   most cases it will be better to (also) specify how to do mutually
   authenticated encryption.

   In all cases, IETF protocols MUST minimise the amount of personal
   data sent.

   Note that this is contingent on practicality - if some personal data
   really has to be sent in clear for a protocol to be able to operate,
   and even opportunistic encryption is not possible, then a standards-
   track protocol that does not define how to protect that data will be
   consistent with this BCP.  The IETF will have to decide in such cases
   whether standardising that protocol benefits the Internet or not.

   Specifications that do not meet the criteria above MUST include (or
   reference) an explanation of why they do not conform to this BCP.
